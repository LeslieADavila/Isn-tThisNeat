        <h3>About Me.</h3>
          <p>Hello! My name is Vanessa Garcia. I am 23 years old. Currently, I am residing in Gruver, TX. I am engaged to a lovely man, Juan, and expect to be married in the summer of 2020. I have a lot of interests and opinions, some of which will be reflected here. I want everyone to know that my opinions and actions are my own.>/p>
          <p>Currently, I am a second-grade teacher. Most would tell you that being a teacher is worth all the struggles. I would completely agree! I became a teacher to inspire the next generation to do what I couldn't. Whilst working as a teacher, I learned that technology has taken over classrooms. I grew up with technology, but even I am finding that my students know more than I do!</p>
          <p>I believe that part of being an adult is understanding that you're going to learn new things everyday from unexpected sources. My kids inspired me to continue my education. As such, I am in the process of obtaining my masters in Instructional Design and Technology. In my time, I have taken the following courses: Web Design (Dreamweaver), Photoshop, Advanced Office Skills, and Design for Technologists.</p>
          <p>I have room to grow, of course. At the same time, I have a lot to offer. Working with children has taught me to adapt my priorities, so I am flexible. I know that things do not always go to plan, so while I pay attention to details, I am intuitive and adaptable. I hope you learn something new about me.</p>
