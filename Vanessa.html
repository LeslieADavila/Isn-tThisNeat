    <p class="text_column"><br> 
    <p>Hello! My name is Vanessa Garcia. I am 23 years old. I am currently residing in Gruver, TX. I'm engaged to be married in the summer of 2020. I have a lot of interests and opinions, some of which will be reflected here. I want everyone to know that my opinions and actions are my own. I strive to be empathetic and understanding, yet open to information.</p>
	  <br>
    <p class="text_column">Currently, I am a second grade teacher. Most would tell you that being a teacher is worth all the struggles, and I would agree! You certainly don't get into teaching for the paycheck! You become a teacher because you're hoping to inspire the next generation to do what you couldn't.Whilst working as a teacher, I have learned that technology has taken over classrooms. I grew up with technology, but even I am finding that my students know more than I do!</p>
	  <br>
    <p class="text_column">I am certainly not bitter about it, I promise! I believe that part of being an adult is understanding that you're going to learn new things everyday from unexpected sources. My kids inspired me to continue my education. As such, I am in the process of obtaining my masters in Instructional Design and Technology. In my time, I have taken the following courses: Web Design (Dreamweaver), Photoshop, Advanced Office Skills, and Design for Technologists.</p>
	  <br>
	<p class="text_column">I believe I have room to grow, of course. At the same time, I believe I have a lot to offer if given the chance. Working with children has taught me to adapt my priorities, so I am flexible. I know that things do not always go to plan, so while I pay attention to details, I am intuitive and adaptable. </p>
