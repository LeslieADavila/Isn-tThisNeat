                    <h2>About me!</h2>
                    <p>My name is Vanessa N. Garcia. I am currently 23 years old, residing in Gruver, TX. I am currently engaged
                    and have plans to marry in the summer of 2020. I graduated in 2018 and have worked in education since. I am 
                    a second grade teacher. As a teacher, I learned that technology is becoming increasingly important in the
                    classroom. I am finding that my students know more about technology than I do. Whilst teaching, I have decided
                    to pursue my masters in Instructional Design and Technology. During my time in the program, I have taken the
                    following courses: Web Design (Dreamweaver), Photoshop, Advanced Office Skills (Word and Excel), and Design for
                    Technologists. I have recently taken up photography and have used Photoship to enhance my photos.</p>
